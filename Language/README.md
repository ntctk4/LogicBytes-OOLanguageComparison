# Language Purpose/Genesis
* Why was the language created?
	* Java
		* Java was originally created to be used for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the industry at the time, so transitioned to the internet instead of devices. The project for Java was started in 1991.
	* C#
		* C# was created by Microsoft to make a "C-like" Object Oriented Language. The project was started in 1999. Flaws from other popular languages (C++, Java, etc.) drove the designs of C#.

* What problems was the language trying to address?
	* Java
		* Originally Java was designed for interactive television. After that, Java was made to "Write Once, Run Anywhere". There were five main goals when java was being developed: 1. simple, OO, and familiar, 2. Robust and Secure, 3. Architecture Neutral and portable, 4. High Performance, 5. Interpreted, Threaded and Dynamic.
	* C#
		* C# was created to take the good parts of the existing popular languages (like Java) and improving them. When building C# the objectives were: 1. make C# simple, 2. make C# modern, 3. make C# OO.
* Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?
	* Java
		* Java was not a reaction or a replacement for another language. Java was originally created for digital television but shifted and released to the public in 1995.
	* C#
		* C# was created in response to the popular languages at the time (including java). C# was created to take the good parts of the existing popular languages and add improved features to the language.
