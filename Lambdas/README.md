# Lambda Expressions, Closures, or Functions as Types

* There are lamda expressions in the newest version of Java, Java 8.
  There are also lambda expressions in C#.
  Lambda expressions are an anonymous function that can be passed around.
  This essentially means that both have closures as well.
  Closures are functions that remember the variables within their scope.
  This also means that both languages can have functions as types.
  However, C# has more capability at this by using delegates.
  Delegates are objects that refer to a certain function.
