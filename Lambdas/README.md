# Lambda Expressions, Closures, or Functions as Types

* ### *Lambda Expressions:*
  There are lamda expressions in the newest version of Java, Java 8.
  There are also lambda expressions in C#.
  Lambda expressions are an anonymous function that can be passed around before being called.

* ### *Closures:*
  Having lambda expressions essentially means that both languages have closures as well.
  Closures are functions that remember the variables within their scope.
  The lambda expressions can act as closures when needed and the terms are usually used interchangeably.

* ### *Functions as Types:*
  Since both languages have lambda expressions, they can have functions as types.
  This is because lambda expressions act like function types.
  However, C# has more capability for this by utilizing delegates.
  Delegates are objects that refer to a certain function, like a function pointer.
