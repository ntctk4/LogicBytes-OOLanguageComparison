# Functional Programming

* ### *Does the language support functional programming?*
Functional programming: is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data (Wikipedia). 
Java & C#: Although both languages are not pure functioal languages (they are more of a procedural language), they do support functional prgramming. For instance C# does support delegation, recursion, tuples, closures, and lambda expressions. Also, Java supports delegation, lambda expressions, recursion, closures, ect. In addition, there are new open source libraries that help faciliate functioal programming in these languages such as "Functional Java".
