# Procedural Programming
* ### *Does the language support procedural programming?*

**Procedural Programming:** which at times has been referred to as inline programming takes a more top down approach to programming. Object-oriented Programming uses classes and objects, Procedural Programming takes on applications by solving problems from the top of the code down to the bottom (neonbrand.com).

**Java & C#:**Although java and C# are seen as a pure object oriented programming language, it is in fact a mix between procedural and OOP. both support prucedural concepts such as (wikipedia):

*delimit the part of the program (body) that makes up the subroutine
*assign an identifier (name) to the subroutine (which is a method in c# and java)
*specify the names and data types of its parameters and return values
*provide a private naming scope for its temporary variables
*call the subroutine
*provide values to its parameters
*dispose of the values returned by a call
*identify variables outside the subroutine that are accessible within it
*package subroutines into a module, library, object, class, etc.

In addition, you would notice that the two programming languages implements divide and conqure techniqes, which helps us to construct code into small fucntions or method for easier debugging and reusabiltiy.
