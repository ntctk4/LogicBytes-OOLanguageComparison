# Types

* ### *What types does the language support?*
  #### C# Value Types:
  * bool
  * byte
  * char
  * decimal
  * double
  * enum
  * float
  * int
  * long
  * sbyte
  * short
  * struct
  * uint
  * ulong
  * ushort

  #### C# Reference Types:
  * class
  * delegate
  * dynamic
  * interface
  * object
  * string

  #### Java Value Types:
  * boolean
  * byte
  * char
  * double
  * float
  * int
  * long
  * short

  #### Java Reference Types:
  * array
  * interface
  * object
  * string

* ### *Are both reference and value types supported?*
  In both Java and C# there are value types and reference types.
  Value types are held on the stack, whereas the reference types are on the heap.
  Value types can not be passed to methods and modified, but reference types can be.

* ### *Can new value types be created?*
  In Java, new value types can not be created.
  However, in C#, new value types can be created and user-defined structs can also be created.
  This is done by extending the ValueType Class with a custom class.
