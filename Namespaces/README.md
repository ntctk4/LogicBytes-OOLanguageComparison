# Namespaces

* ### *How are name spaces implemented?*
  C# has namespaces, while Java uses something related called packages.
  Packages are similar to namespaces in C#, but there are a few differences.
  Namespaces are created within files and there can be multiple namespaces within a single file.
  In Java, a file belongs to a single package and the directory structure must match the package structure.

* ### *How are name spaces used?*
  Namespaces are used to determine accessibility of code and to help organize code into groups.
  They can also help prevent name collisions from occuring.
  Packages are used for the same reasons as namespaces, their implementation is just different.
