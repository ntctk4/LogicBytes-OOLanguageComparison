# Null/Nil References

* Which does the language use? (null/nil/etc)
Both Java and C# use null reference. They are exactly the same in terms of memory managements and catching them. It is currently used for undefined or empty values. Also, it can only be used in reference types such as strings and objects.

* Does the language have features for handling null/nil references?
Yes, both languages do support functions and operations that handle null situations. For instance, to check if an object is null (in both languages) you can use double equal sign such as the following: if (object == null) return true or do something. You can do the same to check if the object is not null by using: if (object != null) return true or do something.
