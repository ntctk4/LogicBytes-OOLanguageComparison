# Classes

## Both Java and C#
* Defining/Constructors:
```java
public class MyClass {
    // Default Constructor Automatically Provided
    // Unless Other Constructor(s) Defined
    public MyClass() { };
}
```
* Instantiating:
```java
MyClass myClass = new MyClass();
```
* Deconstruction:

  Both Java and C# use garbage collection.  There is no way to manually destroy an object.  When an object is no longer referenced it is collected and destroyed by the garbage collector.
