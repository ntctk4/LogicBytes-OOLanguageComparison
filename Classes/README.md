# Classes

## Both Java and C#
* Defining/Constructors:

      public class MyClass {
          // Default Constructor Automatically Provided
          // Unless Other Constructor(s) Defined
          public MyClass() { };
      }

* Instantiating:

      MyClass myClass = new MyClass();

* Deconstruction:

  Both Java and C# use garbage collection.  There is no way to manually destroy an object.  When an object is no longer referenced it is collected and destroyed by the garbage collector.
