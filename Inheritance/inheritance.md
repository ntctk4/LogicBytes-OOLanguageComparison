# Inheritance/Extension

  There are interfaces and class extensions in both C# and Java.
  Interfaces are implemented by classes and classes can extend other classes.
  However, an interface can extend other interfaces.
  They are treated the same in both programming languages, except for their differing syntax.
  Only one class can be extended by another, but multiple interfaces can be inherited.
