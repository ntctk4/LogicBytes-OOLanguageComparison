# Inheritance/Extension

There are class extensions and interfaces in both C# and Java.
Classes can extend other classes and interfaces are implemented by classes.
However, an interface can extend other interfaces.
Only one class can be extended by another, but multiple interfaces can be implemented by a class or extended by an interface.
Therefore neither language supports multiple inheritance, but implementing multiple interfaces is a solution to this problem.
Inheritance is treated the same in both programming languages, except for their differing syntax.
